# My Journey into Programming

This is where it all began. These are my first steps into programming and learning. Every line of code, every mistake, and every solution brings me closer to mastering the art of coding. This is just the beginning of a long and exciting journey in the world of programming.

In this repository, I have documented the foundational exercises and learning experiences from my early days at Holberton School. It reflects my first encounters with various programming concepts and tools, laying the groundwork for future learning and growth.

Some key highlights of this repository include:
- Initial setup and configuration of my development environment.
- Basic exercises to understand Linux, Git, and other essential tools.
- Early challenges that pushed me to think logically and solve problems through code.

Iâ€™m continuously working on improving my skills and adding more projects as I progress on my programming journey.
